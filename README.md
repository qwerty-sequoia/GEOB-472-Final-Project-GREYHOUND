### Introduction
Greyhound Canada is ending its passenger bus and freight services in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and cancelling all but one route in B.C. -- a U.S. run service between Vancouver and Seattle. "This decision is regretful and we sympathize with the fact that many small towns are going to lose service, but simply put, the issue that we have seen is the routes in rural parts to Canada -- specifically Western Canada -- are just not sustainable anymore."

The social impacts of relying on private companies to provide important public services are profound and have real human consequences in British Columbia. An example of these risks is seen in the closure of Greyhound bus routes in BC: first the closure of northern routes and then the complete shutdown of their entire network. Now almost two years later, we can examine how the province has recovered through a mix of public and private services, in addition to identifying areas still in urgent need of transportation. A compelling story, this event disproportionately affected the poor and first nations communities.

Due to the complex nature of this project, we will first demonstrate the entire picture of BC that was served by the old Greyhound network, and then focus in on two case studies. The first will examine access to Hospitals and Emergency Rooms with and without Greyhound for Rural communities, and the Second will take an in-depth look surrounding the "Trail of Tears" in Northern BC and how the gap left by Greyhound has been filled. 

Nonsocial transient spaces are a privatized public space and a public zone where people prefer to be left alone. The closure of Greyhound bus routes brings impacts to both social and economic factors in isolated communities. For example, British Columbia’s Missing Women Commission of Inquiry issued its final report in 2012, the provincial government was urged to “develop and implement an enhanced public transit system to provide a safer travel option connecting Northern communities, particularly along Highway 16” from Prince George to Prince Rupert —perhaps better known as the Highway of Tears, so named for all of the women, many Indigenous, who have gone missing or were murdered along that stretch of highway. With a lack of public transportation along this highway to connect more remote communities and First Nations to urban areas, many of those women had been forced to rely on hitchhiking, which put them at risk. This will be examined later in the essay.

Overall, it is important to examine these impacts because those in rural areas with limited car access and who cannot afford train tickets (if any trains do stop in their communities) are left completely cut off from the rest of the province. This is especially true during harsh winter months were Greyhound was the only way to cross most highways without freezing to death unless you had a heated car with snow tires. The BC Transport Commission forced Greyhound to operate at a loss through their first winter after announcing intent to shut down to avoid deaths and give time for replacement services to flourish.

### All Municipalities in BC & The Closed Greyhound Network

<img width="1115" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-09 at 2 29 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46465672/55836604-e3ebee00-5ad3-11e9-84d0-c6c4218b8beb.png">

In this proportional symbols map, we are able to identify the small communities in need. As expected, the highest population centres are concentrated in Southern BC, where there are already a high level of connectivity. The smaller communities are spread out as we move to Northern BC.

Start by clicking the map to enable the interactivity function. You can hover over each population centre to see more information regarding the city or town.


As shown, even before the Greyhound Network illustrated in this interactive map left BC most communities were already disconnected. They remain disconnected today, but previously they didn't need to travel too far before reaching a Greyhound bus stop, where long term parking solutions were very common. The network itself consisted of 16 different routes before they began to close, first in Northern BC and Vancouver Island then in all of Western Canada.

This map can be interacted with by clicking on any municipality with a bus stop. The surrounding routes that could be accessed from there will be highlighted, and the infobox will be updated with information about the city. The search bar may also be used for ease of finding a particular location in BC. Please be sure to click off of the city you have selected before clicking another for the highlighting function to work properly.

As we would imagine, transportation is critically important for so many reasons; we are focusing as mentioned on health and security.

### Health service without networks

<img width="995" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-09 at 2 30 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46465672/55836681-14cc2300-5ad4-11e9-88a0-6e40bc13798a.png">

Greyhound bus cuts raise health and safety concerns among rural communities, especially indigenous groups. Indigenous groups and advocates are voicing their concern about impacts the cut to Greyhound bus services in Western Canada will have on safety and access to health services. The loss of bus service will have a significant impact, especially for those people who don’t own a vehicle or have a driver’s license.

The Northern Health Authority has a bus that allows patients to make appointments. It cannot successfully link rural residents to all the services they need, nor does it allow them to visit relatives or purchase equally important groceries. Overall health. The Northern Health Authority does provide transit options for patients and their families, but advocates say it cannot meet the full transportation needs of the communities in the area.

Use the interactive slider to view how crucial the Greyhound network was for connecting rural communities to hospitals and emergency rooms. Further consider that in order to have a specialist appointment, most people must go to the lower mainland to receive care. None of these communities now have that option; if they can't use the above Health Authority bus, they must find a way to get to a train and pay far more than the bus ticket would have cost.

Compared to the provincial level, the Metro Vancouver area is hyperconnected. As a hypothetical experiment, use the slider to see what would happen if Vancouver's network closed as Greyhound's has. 

Red crosses here represent hospitals, and bus stop symbol represents Translink bus stops. Through this representation, you can compare the density of transit to the provincial level. Most hospitals are along major transit routes, but provincially they are now isolated.

Despite the ease of connection in Vancouver, the continuous influx of migrants means there are still a number of people that do not have access to healthcare. "Access to basic and essential services will be determined by need and not migration status" is a principal by the Sanctuary city initiative. Regardless of a person's immigration status, this initiative sets out to provide health services, food security, dignified housing, public transit, public safety, legal aid, and municipal services for everyone.

### Safety and Accessibility in Northern BC

The Highway of Tears represents a deadly area for hitchhikers, especially women, as mentioned in the introduction. This case study examines the needs of the Highway, and how they have been filled in the wake of Greyhound's closure. Please scroll to view these insights, and feel free to interact with the map behind these infoboxes to use a timeline and watch as replacement services begin operations even as Greyhound ends theirs.

### Final Thoughts

There are countless more examples that could be examined in depth surrounding this issue. There are at least 1200 seasonal jobs that are now lost without the use of Greyhound, including critical ones in the agriculture center. The entirety of BC now loses one of the few links for the poor to visit the rest of Canada, as Greyhound shut down inter-provincial routes as well. Some Ferry services will need to shut down because greyhound brought them their passengers; one mother says she must pays $1100 just to see her son on Haida Gwaii via plane. 

Every area still needs more service, just like in the above analysis. Families can no longer visit most provincial parks along these routes, which Greyhound would frequently stop at in the summertime. The social and economic consequences of this loss are profound and will echo across the province for years to come.

 The authors of this story worry that public, non-profit lines like in Northern BC will be ridiculed and shut down by governments looking for things that don't make money. We hope that this story gives just a small glimpse into the critical importance of these services existing well into the future, and in a better form than they do now.

Thank you for reading.
